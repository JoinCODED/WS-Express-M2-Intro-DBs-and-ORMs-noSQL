NoSQL database technology stores information in JSON documents instead of columns and rows used by relational databases. NoSQL stands for “not only SQL". This means a NoSQL JSON database can store and retrieve data using literally “no SQL.”

Or you can combine the flexibility of JSON with the power of SQL for the best of both worlds. NoSQL databases are built to be flexible, scalable, and capable of rapidly responding to the data management demands of modern businesses. The following defines the four most-popular types of NoSQL database:

- **Document databases** are primarily built for storing information as documents, including, but not limited to, JSON documents. These systems can also be used for storing XML documents, for example.

- **Key-value** stores group associated data in collections with records that are identified with unique keys for easy retrieval. Key-value stores have just enough structure to mirror the value of relational databases while still preserving the benefits of NoSQL.

- **Wide-column** databases use the tabular format of relational databases yet allow a wide variance in how data is named and formatted in each row, even in the same table. Like key-value stores, wide-column databases have some basic structure while also preserving a lot of flexibility.

- **Graph databases** use graph structures to define the relationships between stored data points. Graph databases are useful for identifying patterns in unstructured and semi-structured information.
