ORM stands for **O**bject-**R**elational **M**apping, which is a process that maps objects into a database table.

An ORM is a library that provides CRUD methods that makes it easier to interact with databases. It helps manage queries for multiple tables in an effective manner.

Instead of interacting directly with a database, the ORM handles the movement of data between your application and the database.

ORM tools let you interact with a database using your language of choice. You'll write your applications in one language (JavaScript in our case) instead of two (JavaScript & SQL). This will speed up the development time, and this often makes managing data less error-prone.

The ORM that we will be using is called Mongoose.
